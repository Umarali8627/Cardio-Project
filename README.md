ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction â€” Machine Learning & Flask Web App
ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

The project is divided into two main parts:

Model Development â€“ Data preprocessing, training, and evaluation (in Jupyter Notebook)

Web Deployment â€“ A Flask-based app for real-time predictions through a simple HTML form

ðŸŽ¯ Features

âœ… Predict heart disease risk based on health metrics
âœ… Interactive web form for easy data input
âœ… High-performance ML model with ROC-AUC: 0.994
âœ… Flask backend for serving predictions
âœ… Modular and scalable code structure
